# a crude attempt at a task reminder
i couldn't be bothered to keep trying out multiple applications to find out which suited my purposes. so i figured i could just write my own.
admittedly it is taking me a bit more longer than i initially cared to put into this.

regardless, the code in its current state is frankly very bad. i just put this together in a very brute-force manner. i'll be cleaning it up and switching to other libraries for cli (or maybe some custom implementation) eventually.

Dependencies:
- click
- loguru
- tabulate
